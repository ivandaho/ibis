Ivan's Blues Improv Simulator

uses: Tone.js, MidiConvert, jQuery

currently does:
1. open riffs.mid with the file button
2. load riffs into library
3. press start
4. when you feel like it, begin the main part

*warning: might be loud*

It randomizes phrases from an array and uses the same "starting" phrase every 8 iterations to give a sense of complete loop.
